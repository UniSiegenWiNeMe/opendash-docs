## About open.DASH

open.DASH ist an open source visualization framework written mainly in javascript. It allows you to provide a dashboard for your users, which is connected to your existing data sources, your user management and other http/websocket sources.

## Getting started

There are two ways to work with open.DASH:
 - [Use our Command Line Interface (CLI)](/guides/using-the-cli.md) to use open.DASH for developing your own visualizations as stand alone
 - [Use our library](/guides/using-the-Api-Class.md) to generate an Angularjs module to use in your existing Angularjs application.
