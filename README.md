## About open.DASH
HERE BE INTRO TEXT

open.DASH ist an open source visualization framework written mainly in javascript. 

## Prerequisites 

Either way you want to work with open.DASH, you need to 

- install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) version  `>=7.6.0` and 
- use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) version `>=5.3.0` (console: `npm i -g npm@latest`).

npm is a JavaScript package manager, that is very popular in Node.js development. It allows you to pull packages, other developers have created. We also use it for open.DASH, which is why you can it from there to start working. 

You can check your node version by using `node -v` and your npm version by running `npm -v` in your console.

This guide further assumes that you know 
 - features of [ES2015 Javascript language](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) like const/let, arrow functions and classes
 - feature of [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) `^1.5`, especially components and services
 - build tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)(IS THIS THE RIGHT LINK?)

## Getting started

There are two ways to work with open.DASH:
 - [Use our Command Line Interface (CLI)](/guides/using-the-cli.md) to use open.DASH for developing your own visualizations as stand alone
 - [Use our library](/guides/using-the-Api-Class.md) to generate an Angularjs module to use in your existing Angularjs application.
