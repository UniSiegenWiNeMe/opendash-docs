# Using the API Class
HERE BE TEXT
## Installation

After completing the [Prerequisites](), you have everything you need.
Now pull opendash from npm by typing in your command line:

```
npm install --save opendash
```

This should work from every folder, since npm is installed globally on your machine.

Then, get the open.DASH Class by requiring it in the file xou want to use open.DASH in. Secondly, create an instance to be able to use the API (IN WHICH FILE??).


```js
import openDASH from 'opendash';

const instance = new openDASH();
```
