Right now custom user adapters are possible but not supported right now and will be added in the comming updates.

There are two adapters right now:

- [A local data adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opendash/user-adapter-local)
- [The baasbox data adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opendash/user-adapter-baasbox)
